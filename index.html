      <h2>Well, the parents have sold the cabin so I guess I'll be doing more camping from now on. 
         I'd better gear up!  Here's what I'll need from the Sierra Trading post:</h2>

      <h3>First, I'll need a tent and a place to get away from the skeeters.</h3>
      <span class='tent-placeholder'></span>

      <h3>Then a comfy chair and a table.</h3>
      <div class='furniture-placeholder'></div>

      <h3>And I reckon I'll want to eat sometimes, so I'll need a few kitchen things. Titanium is cool, I'll get everything in titanium.</h3>
      <div class='kitchen-placeholder'></div>

      <h3>They even sell food here, so I'll get some of that. A big old can of freeze-dried corn, that should do it. </h3>
      <div class='food-placeholder'></div>

      <h3>So that's it, I'm ready for the new cabinless future, but its going to cost me. $<span class="coin"></span>, to be exact.
